      <h2>Paroles Tim McGraw</h2>
      <h3>Sortie : 19 juin 2006</h3>
        He said the way my blue eyes shined<br>
        Put those Georgia stars to shame that night<br>
        I said, "That's a lie"<br>
        Just a boy in a Chevy truck<br>
        That had a tendency of gettin' stuck<br>
        On back roads at night<br>
        And I was right there beside him all summer long<br>
        And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone<br>
        <br>
        But when you think Tim McGraw<br>
        I hope you think my favorite song<br>
        The one we danced to all night long<br>
        The moon like a spotlight on the lake<br>
        When you think happiness<br>
        I hope you think that little black dress<br>
        Think of my head on your chest<br>
        And my old faded blue jeans<br>
        When you think Tim McGraw<br>
        I hope you think of me<br>
        <br>
        September saw a month of tears<br>
        And thankin' God that you weren't here<br>
        To see me like that<br>
        But in a box beneath my bed<br>
        Is a letter that you never read<br>
        From three summers back<br>
        It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet<br>
        And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe<br>
        <br>
        When you think Tim McGraw<br>
        I hope you think my favorite song<br>
        The one we danced to all night long<br>
        The moon like a spotlight on the lake<br>
        When you think happiness<br>
        I hope you think that little black dress<br>
        Think of my head on your chest<br>
        And my old faded blue jeans<br>
        When you think Tim McGraw<br>
        I hope you think of me<br>
        <br>
        And I'm back for the first time since then<br>
        I'm standin' on your street<br>
        And there's a letter left on your doorstep<br>
        And the first thing that you'll read is:<br>
        <br>
        "When you think Tim McGraw<br>
        I hope you think my favorite song<br>
        Someday you'll turn your radio on<br>
        I hope it takes you back to that place"<br>
        <br>
        When you think happiness<br>
        I hope you think that little black dress<br>
        Think of my head on your chest<br>
        And my old faded blue jeans<br>
        When you think Tim McGraw<br>
        I hope you think of me<br>
        <br>
        Oh, think of me<br>
        Mmmm<br>
        <br>
        He said the way my blue eyes shined<br>
        Put those Georgia stars to shame that night<br>
        I said, "That's a lie"

      <h2>Paroles Teardrops On My Guitar</h2>
      <h3>Sortie : 20 février 2007</h3>
      Drew looks at me<br>
      I fake a smile so he won't see<br>
      That I want and I'm needing<br>
      Everything that we should be<br>
      <br>
      I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about<br>
      And she's got everything that I have to live without<br>
      <br>
      Drew talks to me<br>
      I laugh 'cause it's just so funny<br>
      That I can't even see<br>
      Anyone when he's with me<br>
      <br>
      He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right<br>
      I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night<br>
      <br>
      He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar<br>
      The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star<br>
      He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do<br>
      <br>
      Drew walks by me<br>
      Can he tell that I can't breathe?<br>
      And there he goes, so perfectly<br>
      The kind of flawless I wish I could be<br>
      <br>
      She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love<br>
      Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause<br>
      <br>
      He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar<br>
      The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star<br>
      He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do<br>
      <br>
      So, I drive home alone<br>
      As I turn out the light<br>
      I'll put his picture down<br>
      And maybe get some sleep tonight<br>
      <br>
      'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar<br>
      The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart<br>
      He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do<br>
      <br>
      He's the time taken up, but there's never enough<br>
      And he's all that I need to fall into<br>
      <br>
      Drew looks at me<br>
      I fake a smile so he won't see

      <h2>Paroles Our Song</h2>
      <h3>Sortie : 4 septembre 2007</h3>
        I was riding shotgun<br>
        With my hair undone<br>
        In the front seat of his car<br>
        He's got a one-hand feel<br>
        On the steering wheel<br>
        The other on my heart<br>
        I look around, turn the radio down<br>
        He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"<br>
        I say, "Nothing<br>
        I was just thinking<br>
        How we don't have a song"<br>
        And he says...<br>
        <br>
        Our song is the slamming screen door<br>
        Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window<br>
        When we're on the phone and you talk real slow<br>
        'Cause it's late and your mama don't know<br>
        Our song is the way you laugh<br>
        The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have."<br>
        And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen"<br>
        Asking God if he could play it again<br>
        <br>
        I was walking up<br>
        The front porch steps<br>
        After everything that day<br>
        Had gone all wrong<br>
        And been trampled on<br>
        And lost and thrown away<br>
        Got to the hallway,<br>
        Well, on my way<br>
        To my lovin' bed<br>
        I almost didn't notice<br>
        All the roses<br>
        And the note that said...<br>
        <br>
        Our song is the slamming screen door<br>
        Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window<br>
        When we're on the phone and you talk real slow<br>
        'Cause it's late and your mama don't know<br>
        Our song is the way you laugh<br>
        The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"<br>
        And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen"<br>
        Asking God if he could play it again<br>
        <br>
        I've heard every album, listened to the radio<br>
        Waited for something to come along<br>
        That was as good as our song...<br>
        <br>
        'Cause our song is the slamming screen door<br>
        Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window<br>
        When we're on the phone and he talks real slow<br>
        'Cause it's late and his mama don't know<br>
        Our song is the way he laughs<br>
        The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"<br>
        And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen"<br>
        Asking God if he could play it again<br>
        Play it again<br>
        <br>
        Oh, yeah...<br>
        Oh-oh, yeah<br>
        <br>
        I was riding shotgun<br>
        With my hair undone<br>
        In the front seat of his car<br>
        I grabbed a pen<br>
        And an old napkin<br>
        And I wrote down our song

      <h2>Paroles Picture To Burn</h2>
      <h3>Sortie : 3 février 2008</h3>
        State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy<br>
        I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me<br>

        That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay!<br>
        By the way...<br>
        <br>
        I hate that stupid old pickup truck<br>
        You never let me drive<br>
        You're a redneck heartbreak<br>
        Who's really bad at lying<br>
        So watch me strike a match<br>
        On all my wasted time<br>
        As far as I'm concerned<br>
        You're just another picture to burn!<br>
        <br>
        There's no time for tears<br>

        You're just another picture to burn!<br>
        <br>
        And if you're missing me<br>
        You'd better keep it to yourself<br>
        'Cause coming back around here<br>
        Would be bad for your health...<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck<br>
        You never let me drive<br>
        You're a redneck heartbreak<br>
        Who's really bad at lying<br>
        So watch me strike a match<br>

      <h2>Paroles Should've Said No</h2>
      <h3>Sortie : 19 mai 2008</h3>
        It's strange to think the songs we used to sing<br>
        The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone<br>
        Yesterday I found out about you<br>
        Even now just looking at you feels wrong<br>
        <br>
        You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance<br>
        It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."<br>
        <br>
        You should've said "No", you should've gone home<br>
        You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go<br>
        You should've known that word<br>
        Bout what you did with her'd<br>
        Get back to me (get back to me).<br>
        And I should've been there in the back of your mind<br>
        I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"<br>
        You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...<br>
        You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me<br>
        <br>
        You can see that I've been crying<br>
        And baby, you know all the right things to say<br>
        But do you honestly expect me to believe<br>
        We could ever be the same?<br>
        <br>
        You say that the past is the past, you need one chance<br>
        It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."<br>
        <br>
        You should've said "No", you should've gone home<br>
        You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go<br>
        You should've known that word<br>
        'Bout what you did with her'd,<br>
        Get back to me (get back to me).<br>
        And I should've been there in the back of your mind<br>
        I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"<br>
        You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...<br>
        You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me<br>
        <br>
        I can't resist<br>
        Before you go, tell me this:<br>
        Was it worth it?<br>
        Was she worth this?<br>
        <br>
        No... no, no, no...<br>
        <br>
        You should've said "No", you should've gone home<br>
        You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go<br>
        You should've known that word<br>
        'Bout what you did with her'd,<br>
        Get back to me (get back to me).<br>
        And I should've been there in the back of your mind<br>
        I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"<br>
        You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...<br>
