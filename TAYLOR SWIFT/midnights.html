      <h2>Paroles Anti-Hero</h2>
      <h3>Sortie : 21 octobre 2022</h3>
      <div>
        I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser<br>
        Midnights become my afternoons<br>
        When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people<br>
        I've ghosted stand there in the room<br>
        <br>
        I should not be left to my own devices<br>
        They come with prices and vices<br>
        I end up in crisis<br>
        (Tale as old as time)<br>
        I wake up screaming from dreaming<br>
        One day, I'll watch as you're leaving<br>
        'Cause you got tired of my scheming<br>
        (For the last time)<br>
        <br>
        It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me<br>
        At teatime, everybody agrees<br>
        I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror<br>
        It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby<br>
        And I'm a monster on the hill<br>
        Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city<br>
        Pierced through the heart, but never killed<br>
        <br>
        Did you hear my covert narcissism<br>
        I disguise as altruism<br>
        Like some kind of congressman?<br>
        (A tale as old as time)<br>
        I wake up screaming from dreaming<br>
        One day, I'll watch as you're leaving<br>
        And life will lose all its meaning<br>
        (For the last time)<br>
        <br>
        It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)<br>
        At teatime, everybody agrees<br>
        I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror<br>
        It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero<br>
        <br>
        I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money<br>
        She thinks I left them in the will<br>
        The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out<br>
        "She's laughing up at us from Hell"<br>
        <br>
        It's me, hi<br>
        I'm the problem, it's me<br>
        It's me, hi<br>
        I'm the problem, it's me<br>
        It's me, hi<br>
        Everybody agrees, everybody agrees<br>
        <br>
        It's me, hi (Hi), I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)<br>
        At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)<br>
        I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror<br>
        It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

        Meet me at midnight<br>
        Ooh ooh ooh whoa<br>
        <br>
        Staring at the ceiling with you<br>
        Oh, you don't ever say too much<br>
        And you don't really read into<br>
        My melancholia<br>
        I've been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh yeah)<br>
        You handle it beautifully (Yeah, oh yeah)<br>
        All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh yeah)<br>
        <br>
        I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me<br>
        Surreal<br>

      <h2>Paroles Karma</h2>
      <h3>Sortie : 1er mai 2023</h3>
      <div>
        You're talking shit for the hell of it<br>
        Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant<br>
        You're terrified to look down<br>
        'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare<br>
        Of everyone you burned just to get there<br>
        It's coming back around<br>
        <br>
        And I keep my side of the street clean<br>
        You wouldn't know what I mean<br>
        <br>
        'Cause karma is my boyfriend<br>
        Karma is a god<br>
        Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend<br>
        Karma's a relaxing thought<br>
        Aren't you envious that for you it's not?<br>
        Sweet like honey, karma is a cat<br>
        Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me<br>
        Flexing like a goddamn acrobat<br>
        Me and karma vibe like that<br>
        <br>
        Spiderboy, king of thieves<br>
        Weave your little webs of opacity<br>
        My pennies made your crown<br>
        Trick me once, trick me twice<br>
        Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?<br>
        It's coming back around<br>
        <br>
        And I keep my side of the street clean<br>
        You wouldn't know what I mean<br>
        <br>
        'Cause karma is my boyfriend<br>
        Karma is a god<br>
        Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend<br>
        Karma's a relaxing thought<br>
        Aren't you envious that for you it's not?<br>
        Sweet like honey, karma is a cat<br>
        Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me<br>
        Flexing like a goddamn acrobat<br>
        Me and karma vibe like that<br>
        <br>
        Ask me what I learned from all those years<br>
        Ask me what I earned from all those tears<br>
        Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here<br>
        (I'm still here, I'm still here)<br>
        <br>
        'Cause karma is the thunder<br>
        Rattling your ground<br>
        Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter<br>
        Karma's gonna track you down<br>
        Step by step, from town to town<br>
        Sweet like justice, karma is a queen<br>
        Karma takes all my friends to the summit<br>
        Karma is the guy on the screen<br>
        Coming straight home to me<br>
        <br>
        'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend)<br>
        Karma is a god<br>
        Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)<br>
        Karma's a relaxing thought<br>
        Aren't you envious that for you it's not?<br>

        <br>
        Karma is my boyfriend<br>
        Karma is a god (Ah)<br>
        Uh-huh, mm<br>
        Karma's a relaxing thought
