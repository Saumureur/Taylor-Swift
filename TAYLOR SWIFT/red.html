        Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like<br>
        We hadn't seen each other in a month<br>
        When you said you needed space. (What?)<br>
        Then you come around again and say<br>
        "Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me."<br>
        Remember how that lasted for a day?<br>
        I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you."<br>
        <br>
        Ooh, we called it off again last night<br>
        But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you<br>
        <br>
        We are never ever ever getting back together<br>
        We are never ever ever getting back together<br>
        You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me<br>
        But we are never ever ever ever getting back together<br>
        <br>
        Like, ever<br>
        <br>
        I'm really gonna miss you picking fights<br>
        And me falling for it screaming that I'm right<br>
        And you would hide away and find your peace of mind<br>
        With some indie record that's much cooler than mine<br>
        <br>
        Ooh, you called me up again tonight<br>

        Oh oh oh<br>
        <br>
        I used to think that we were forever ever<br>
        And I used to say, "Never say never..."<br>
        Uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you,"<br>
        And I'm like... "I just... I mean this is exhausting, you know, like<br>
        We are never getting back together. Like, ever"<br>

        No!<br>

        He didn't like it when I wore high heels<br>
        But I do<br>
        Turn the lock and put my headphones on<br>
        He always said he didn't get this song<br>
        But I do, I do<br>
        <br>
        Walked in expecting you'd be late<br>
        But you got here early and you stand and wave<br>
        I walk to you<br>
        You pull my chair out and help me in<br>
        And you don't know how nice that is<br>
        But I do<br>
        <br>
        And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid<br>
        I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did<br>
        I've been spending the last eight months<br>
        Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end<br>
        But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again<br>
        <br>
        You said you never met one girl<br>
        Who had as many James Taylor records as you<br>
        But I do<br>
        We tell stories and you don't know why<br>
        I'm coming off a little shy<br>

        <br>
        And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up<br>
        But you start to talk about the movies that your family<br>
        Watches<br>
        Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that<br>
        And for the first time what's past is past<br>

        Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago<br>
        I was in your sights, you got me alone<br>
        You found me, you found me, you found me<br>
        I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that<br>
        And when I fell hard you took a step back<br>
        Without me, without me, without me<br>
        <br>
        And he's long gone when he's next to me<br>
        And I realize the blame is on me<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in<br>

        No apologies. He'll never see you cry<br>
        Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why<br>
        You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning<br>
        Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street<br>
        A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be<br>
        And now I see, now I see, now I see<br>
        <br>
        He was long gone when he met me<br>

        It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters<br>

        Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street<br>
        Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly<br>
        Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall<br>
        Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all<br>
        <br>
        Losing him was blue like I'd never known<br>
        Missing him was dark grey all alone<br>
        Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met<br>
        But loving him was red<br>
        <br>
        (Red, red)<br>
        (Red, red)<br>
        Loving him was red<br>
        (Red, red)<br>
        (Red, red)<br>
        <br>
        Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you<br>
        Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song<br>
        Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer<br>
        Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong<br>
        <br>
        Losing him was blue like I'd never known<br>
        Missing him was dark grey all alone (whoa)<br>
        Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met<br>
        But loving him was red<br>
        (Red, red)<br>
        Oh, red<br>
        (Red, red)<br>
        Burning red<br>
        (Red, red)<br>
        (Red, red)<br>
        <br>
        Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes<br>
        Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go<br>
        But moving on from him is impossible<br>
        When I still see it all in my head<br>
        In burning red<br>
        Burning, it was red<br>
        <br>
        Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known<br>
        Missing him was dark grey all alone (whoa)<br>
        Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met<br>
        'Cause loving him was red<br>
        (Red, red)<br>
        Yeah, yeah, red<br>
        (Red, red)<br>

        And that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head<br>
        (Red, red)<br>
        Comes back to me, burning red<br>
        (Red, red)<br>
        (Red, red)<br>
        Yeah, yeah<br>

          I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now<br>
          I just wanna know you, know you, know you<br>
          <br>
          <i>[Both:]</i><br>
          All I know is we said, "Hello"<br>
          And your eyes look like coming home<br>
          All I know is a simple name<br>
          Everything has changed<br>
          All I know is you held the door<br>
          You'll be mine and I'll be yours<br>
          All I know since yesterday is everything has changed<br>
          <br>
          <i>[Taylor Swift:]</i><br>
          All I know is we said, "Hello"<br>
          So dust off your highest hopes<br>
          All I know is pouring rain and everything has changed<br>
          All I know is a new found grace<br>
          All my days I'll know your face<br>
          All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

          I find myself at your door<br>
          Just like all those times before<br>
          I'm not sure how I got there<br>
          All roads—they lead me here<br>
          <br>
          I imagine you are home<br>
          In your room, all alone<br>
          And you open your eyes into mine<br>
          And everything feels better<br>
          <br>
          <i>[Both:]</i><br>
          And right before your eyes<br>
          I'm breaking, no past<br>
          No reasons why<br>
          Just you and me<br>
          <br>
          This is the last time I'm asking you this<br>
          Put my name at the top of your list<br>
          This is the last time I'm asking you why<br>
          You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye<br>
          <br>
          <i>[Taylor Swift:]</i><br>
          You find yourself at my door<br>
          Just like all those times before<br>
          You wear your best apology<br>
          But I was there to watch you leave<br>
          <br>
          And all the times I let you in<br>
          Just for you to go again<br>
          Disappear when you come back<br>
          Everything is better<br>
          <br>
          <i>[Both:]</i><br>
          And right before your eyes<br>
          I'm aching, no past<br>
          Nowhere to hide<br>
          Just you and me<br>
          <br>
          This is the last time I'm asking you this<br>
          Put my name at the top of your list<br>
          This is the last time I'm asking you why<br>
          You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye<br>
          <br>
          This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong<br>
          This is the last time I say it's been you all along<br>
          This is the last time I let you in my door<br>
          This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore<br>
          <br>
          Oh, oh, oh<br>
          <br>
          This is the last time I'm asking you this<br>
          Put my name at the top of your list<br>
          This is the last time I'm asking you why<br>
          You break my heart in the blink of an eye<br>
          <br>
          This is the last time I'm asking you<br>
          Last time I'm asking you<br>
          Last time I'm asking you this<br>
          This is the last time I'm asking you<br>
          Last time I'm asking you<br>
          Last time I'm asking you this<br>
          This is the last time I'm asking you<br>
          Last time I'm asking you<br>
          Last time I'm asking you this<br>
          This is the last time I'm asking you<br>
          Last time I'm asking you<br>
          Last time I'm asking you this
