      <h2>Paroles willow</h2>
      <h3>Sortie : 11 décembre 2020</h3>
      <div>
        I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night<br>
        Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife<br>
        And if it was an open/shut case<br>
        I never would've known from that look on your face<br>
        Lost in your current like a priceless wine<br>
        <br>
        The more that you say, the less I know<br>
        Wherever you stray, I follow<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
        <br>
        Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind<br>
        Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in<br>
        As if you were a mythical thing<br>
        Like you were a trophy or a champion ring<br>
        And there was one prize I'd cheat to win<br>
        <br>
        The more that you say, the less I know<br>
        Wherever you stray, I follow<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
        You know that my train could take you home<br>
        Anywhere else is hollow<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
        <br>
        Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind<br>
        They count me out time and time again<br>
        Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind<br>
        But I come back stronger than a 90's trend<br>
        <br>
        Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark<br>
        Show me the places where the others gave you scars<br>
        Now this is an open/shut case<br>
        I guess I should've known from the look on your face<br>
        Every bait-and-switch was a work of art<br>
        <br>
        The more that you say, the less I know<br>
        Wherever you stray, I follow<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
        You know that my train could take you home<br>
        Anywhere else is hollow<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
        <br>
        The more that you say, the less I know<br>
        Wherever you stray, I follow<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
        You know that my train could take you home<br>
        Anywhere else is hollow<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans, that's my man<br>
        <br>
        Hey, that's my man<br>
        That's my man<br>
        Yeah, that's my man<br>
        Every bait-and-switch was a work of art<br>
        That's my man<br>
        Hey, that's my man<br>
        I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
        Wreck my plans, that's my man

        <br>
        <i>[Taylor Swift:]</i><br>
        Este's a friend of mine<br>
        We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine<br>
        Este's been losing sleep<br>
        Her husband's acting different and it smells like infidelity<br>
        She says, "That ain't my Merlot on his mouth<br>
        That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"<br>
        No, there ain't no doubt<br>
        I think I'm gonna call him out<br>
        She says<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Taylor Swift and HAIM:]</i><br>
        I think he did it but I just can't prove it<br>
        I think he did it but I just can't prove it<br>
        I think he did it but I just can't prove it<br>
        No, no body, no crime<br>
        But I ain't letting up until the day I die<br>
        <br>
        <i>[HAIM:]</i><br>
        No, no<br>
        I think he did it<br>
        No, no<br>
        He did it<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Taylor Swift:]</i><br>
        Este wasn't there<br>
        Tuesday night at Olive Garden at her job or anywhere<br>
        He reports his missing wife<br>
        And I noticed when I passed his house his truck has got some brand new tires<br>
        And his mistress moved in<br>
        Sleeps in Este's bed and everything<br>
        No, there ain't no doubt<br>
        Somebody's gotta catch him out<br>
        'Cause<br>
        <br>

        I think he did it but I just can't prove it<br>
        No, no body, no crime<br>

        No, no<br>

        No, no<br>
        He did it<br>
        <br>
        Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was 15<br>
        And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene<br>
        Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me ("She was with me dude")<br>
        Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy<br>

        Break my soul in two<br>
        Looking for you but you're right here<br>
        If I can't relate to you anymore<br>
        Then who am I related to?<br>
        And if this is the long haul<br>
        How'd we get here so soon?<br>
        Did I close my fist around something delicate?<br>
        Did I shatter you?<br>
        <br>
        And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island wondering where did my baby go?<br>
        The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go<br>
        Sorry for not making you my centerfold<br>
        <br>
        Over and over<br>
        Lost again with no surprises<br>
        Disappointments, close your eyes<br>
        And it gets colder and colder<br>
        When the sun goes down<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Matt Berninger and Taylor Swift:]</i><br>
        The question pounds my head<br>
        "What's a lifetime of achievement?"<br>
        If I pushed you to the edge<br>
        But you were too polite to leave me<br>
        And do you miss the rogue<br>
        Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?<br>
        Will you forgive my soul<br>
        When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?<br>
        'Cause we were like the mall before the Internet<br>
        It was the one place to be<br>
        The mischief, the gift wrapped suburban dreams<br>
        Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring<br>
        <br>
        Over and over<br>
        Lost again with no surprises<br>
        Disappointments, close your eyes<br>
        And it gets colder and colder<br>
        When the sun goes down<br>
        <br>
        Were you waiting at our old spot<br>
        In the tree line by the gold clock<br>
        Did I leave you hanging every single day?<br>
        Were you standing in the hallway<br>
        With a big cake, happy birthday<br>
        Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest gray?<br>
        A universe away<br>
        And when I got into the accident<br>
        The sight that flashed before me was your face<br>
        But when I walked up to the podium<br>
        I think that I forgot to say your name<br>
        <br>
        I'm on a bench in Coney Island wondering where did my baby go?<br>
        The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go<br>
        Sorry for not making you my centerfold<br>
        Over and over<br>
        <br>
        Lost again with no surprises<br>
        Disappointments, close your eyes<br>
        And it gets colder and colder<br>
        When the sun goes down<br>
        When the sun goes down<br>
        <br>
        The sight that flashed before me was your face<br>
        When the sun goes down<br>
        But I think that I forgot to say your name<br>
        Over and over<br>
        Sorry for not making you my<br>
        Making you my<br>
        Making you my centerfold
