Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him<br>
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted<br>
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom<br>
Holdin' him for ransom, some<br>
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though<br>
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so<br>
I see nothing better, I keep him forever<br>
Like a vendetta-ta<br>
<br>
I, I, I see how this is gon' go<br>
Touch me and you'll never be alone<br>
I-Island breeze and lights down low<br>
No one has to know<br>
<br>
In the middle of the night, in my dreams<br>
You should see the things we do, baby<br>
In the middle of the night, in my dreams<br>
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time<br>
Are you ready for it?<br>
<br>
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me<br>
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry<br>
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and<br>
We'll move to an island, and<br>
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor<br>
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure<br>
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now<br>
Never be the same now, now<br>
<br>
I, I, I see how this is gon' go<br>
Touch me and you'll never be alone<br>
I-Island breeze and lights down low<br>
No one has to know (No one has to know)<br>
<br>
In the middle of the night, in my dreams<br>
You should see the things we do, baby<br>
In the middle of the night in my dreams<br>
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time<br>
Are you ready for it?<br>
Oh, are you ready for it?<br>
<br>
Baby, let the games begin<br>
Let the games begin<br>
Let the games begin<br>
Baby, let the games begin<br>
Let the games begin<br>
Let the games begin<br>
<br>
I, I, I see how this is gon' go<br>
Touch me and you'll never be alone<br>
I-Island breeze and lights down low<br>
No one has to know<br>
<br>
In the middle of the night (Night), in my dreams (My dreams)<br>
You should see the things we do (We do), baby (Baby), hmm (Eh)<br>
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (My dreams)<br>
I know I'm gonna be with you (I know I'm gonna be with you)<br>
So I take my time<br>
In the middle of the night<br>
<br>
Baby, let the games begin<br>
Let the games begin<br>
Let the games begin<br>
Are you ready for it?<br>
Baby, let the games begin<br>

      <h2>Paroles End Game</h2>
      <h3>Sortie : 14 novembre 2017</h3>
      <div>
        <i>[Taylor Swift and Future:]</i><br>
        I wanna be your end game<br>
        I wanna be your first string<br>
        I wanna be your A-Team (Whoa, whoa, whoa)<br>
        I wanna be your end game, end game<br>
        <br>
        Big reputation, big reputation<br>
        Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah<br>
        And you heard about me, ooh<br>
         I got some big enemies (Yeah)<br>
        Big reputation, big reputation<br>
        Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)<br>
        And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)<br>
        You like the bad ones, too<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Future:]</i><br>
        You so dope, don't overdose, I'm so stoked, I need a toast<br>
        We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat<br>
        I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (Yeah)<br>
        I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)<br>
        I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)<br>
        I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (What they like)<br>
        You love it, I love it too 'cause you're my type (You're my type)<br>
        You hold me down and I protect you with my life<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Taylor Swift and Future:]</i><br>
        I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be<br>
        Just another ex-love you don't wanna see<br>
        I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)<br>
        Like the other girls do<br>
        I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be<br>
        Drinking on a beach with you all over me<br>
        I know what they all say (I know what they all say)<br>
        But I ain't tryna play<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Taylor Swift:]</i><br>
        I wanna be your end game (End game)<br>
        I wanna be your first string (First string)<br>
        I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)<br>
        I wanna be your end game, end game<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Ed Sheeran:]</i><br>
        Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older<br>
        Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders<br>
        Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep<br>
        The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me<br>
        Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long<br>
        And you understand the good and bad end up in the song<br>
        For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease<br>
        For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities<br>
        I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny<br>
        After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July<br>
        I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one<br>
        With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Taylor Swift:]</i><br>
        I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be<br>
        Just another ex-love you don't wanna see<br>
        I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)<br>
        Like the other girls do<br>
        I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be<br>
        Drinking on a beach with you all over me<br>
        I know what they all say, yeah<br>
        But I ain't tryna play<br>
        <br>
        I wanna be your end game (End game)<br>
        I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)<br>
        I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)<br>
        I wanna be your end game, end game<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Taylor Swift and Future:]</i><br>
        Big reputation, big reputation<br>
        Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah<br>
        And you heard about me, ooh<br>
         I got some big enemies<br>
        Hey, big reputation, big reputation<br>
        Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah<br>
        And I heard about you, ooh<br>
        You like the bad ones, too<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Taylor Swift:]</i><br>
        I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't<br>
        And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em<br>
        Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy<br>
        I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me<br>
        And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul<br>
        It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold<br>
        You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks<br>
        So here's the truth from my red lips<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Swift, Future, and Ed Sheeran:]</i><br>
        I wanna be your end game (End game)<br>
        I wanna be your first string (Me and you, first string)<br>
        I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now, A-Team)<br>
        I wanna be your end game, end game<br>
        I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do)<br>
        I wanna be your first string (First string)<br>
        I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)<br>
        I wanna be your end game, end game

        Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?<br>
        Phone lights up my nightstand in the black<br>
        Come here, you can meet me in the back<br>
        Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you<br>
        Oh damn, never seen that color blue<br>
        Just think of the fun things we could do<br>
        <br>

        Handsome, you're a mansion with a view<br>
        Do the girls back home touch you like I do?<br>
        Long night, with your hands up in my hair<br>
        Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs<br>
        Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share<br>
