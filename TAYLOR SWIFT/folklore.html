      <h2>Paroles cardigan</h2>
      <h3>Sortie : 24 juillet 2020</h3>
      <div>
        Vintage tee, brand new phone<br>
        High heels on cobblestones<br>
        When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
        Sequin smile, black lipstick<br>
        Sensual politics<br>
        When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
        <br>
        But I knew you<br>
        Dancing in your Levi's<br>
        Drunk under a streetlight, I<br>
        I knew you<br>
        Hand under my sweatshirt<br>
        Baby, kiss it better, I<br>
        <br>
        And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed<br>
        You put me on and said I was your favorite<br>
        A friend to all is a friend to none<br>
        Chase two girls, lose the one<br>
        When you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
        <br>
        But I knew you<br>
        Playing hide-and-seek and<br>
        Giving me your weekends<br>
        I, I knew you<br>
        Your heartbeat on the High Line<br>
        Once in twenty lifetimes, I<br>
        <br>
        And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed<br>
        You put me on and said I was your favorite<br>
        <br>
        To kiss in cars and downtown bars<br>
        Was all we needed<br>
        You drew stars around my scars<br>
        But now I'm bleeding<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I knew you<br>
        Stepping on the last train<br>
        Marked me like a bloodstain, I<br>
        I knew you<br>
        Tried to change the ending<br>
        Peter losing Wendy<br>
        I, I knew you<br>
        Leaving like a father<br>
        Running like water, I<br>
        And when you are young, they assume you know nothing<br>
        <br>
        But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss<br>
        I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs<br>
        The smell of smoke would hang around this long<br>
        'Cause I knew everything when I was young<br>
        I knew I'd curse you for the longest time<br>
        Chasing shadows in the grocery line<br>
        I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired<br>
        And you'd be standing in my front porch light<br>
        And I knew you'd come back to me<br>
        You'd come back to me<br>
        And you'd come back to me<br>
        And you'd come back<br>
        <br>
        And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed<br>
        You put me on and said I was your favorite

        I can see you standin', honey<br>
        With his arms around your body<br>
        Laughin' but the joke's not funny at all<br>
        And it took you five whole minutes<br>
        To pack us up and leave me with it<br>
        Holdin' all this love out here in the hall<br>
        <br>
        I think I've seen this film before<br>
        And I didn't like the ending<br>
        You're not my homeland anymore<br>
        So what am I defendin' now?<br>
        You were my town<br>
        Now I'm in exile seein' you out<br>
        I think I've seen this film before<br>
        <br>
        Hoo, hoo-ooh<br>
        Hoo, hoo-ooh<br>

        I can see you starin', honey<br>
        Like he's just your understudy<br>
        Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me<br>
        Second, third, and hundredth chances<br>
        Balancin' on breaking branches<br>
        Those eyes add insult to injury<br>
        <br>
        I think I've seen this film before<br>
        And I didn't like the ending<br>
        I'm not your problem anymore<br>
        So who am I offending now?<br>
        You were my crown<br>
        Now I'm in exile seein' you out<br>
        I think I've seen this film before<br>

        So step right out<br>
        There is no amount<br>
        Of cryin' I can do for you<br>
        <br>
        All this time<br>
        We always walked a very thin line<br>
        You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)<br>
        You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)<br>
        <br>
        All this time<br>
        I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)<br>

      <h3>Sortie : 17 ao没t 2020</h3>
      <div>
        Betty, I won't make assumptions about why you switched your homeroom<br>
        But I think it's 'cause of me<br>
        Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard when I passed your house<br>
        It's like I couldn't breathe<br>
        You heard the rumors from Inez<br>
        You can't believe a word she says<br>
        Most times, but this time it was true<br>
        The worst thing that I ever did<br>
        Was what I did to you<br>
        <br>
        But if I just showed up at your party<br>
        Would you have me?<br>
        Would you want me?<br>
        Would you tell me to go fuck myself<br>
        Or lead me to the garden?<br>
        In the garden would you trust me<br>
        If I told you it was just a summer thing?<br>
        I'm only seventeen<br>
        I don't know anything but I know I miss you<br>
        <br>
        Betty, I know where it all went wrong<br>
        Your favorite song was playing from the far side of the gym<br>
        I was nowhere to be found, I hate the crowds, you know that<br>
        Plus, I saw you dance with him<br>
        You heard the rumors from Inez<br>
        You can't believe a word she says<br>
        Most times, but this time it was true<br>
        The worst thing that I ever did<br>
        Was what I did to you<br>
        <br>
        But if I just showed up at your party<br>
        Would you have me?<br>
        Would you want me?<br>
        Would you tell me to go fuck myself<br>
        Or lead me to the garden?<br>
        In the garden would you trust me<br>
        If I told you it was just a summer thing?<br>
        I'm only seventeen<br>
        I don't know anything but I know I miss you<br>
        <br>
        I was walking home on broken cobblestones<br>
        Just thinking of you when she pulled up<br>
        Like a figment of my worst intentions<br>
        She said "James, get in, let's drive"<br>
        Those days turned into nights<br>
        Slept next to her but<br>
        I dreamt of you all summer long<br>
        <br>
        Betty, I'm here on your doorstep<br>
        And I planned it out for weeks now but, it's finally sinking in<br>
        Betty, right now is the last time<br>
        I can dream about what happens when you see my face again<br>
        The only thing I wanna do<br>
        Is make it up to you<br>
        <br>
        So, I showed up at your party<br>
        Yeah, I showed up at your party<br>
        Yeah, I showed up at your party<br>
        Will you have me?<br>
        Will you love me?<br>
        Will you kiss me on the porch in front of all your stupid friends?<br>
        If you kiss me<br>
        Will it be just like I dreamed it? Will it patch your broken wings?<br>
        I'm only seventeen<br>
        I don't know anything<br>
        But I know I miss you<br>
        Standing in your cardigan<br>
        Kissing in my car again<br>
        Stopped at a streetlight, you know I miss you
