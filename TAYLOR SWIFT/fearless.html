      <h2>Paroles Love Story</h2>
      <h3>Sortie : 15 septembre 2008</h3>
        <div>
        We were both young when I first saw you<br>
        I close my eyes and the flashback starts:<br>
        I'm standing there<br>
        On a balcony in summer air<br>
        <br>
        See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns<br>
        See you make your way through the crowd<br>
        And say, "Hello."<br>
        Little did I know<br>
        <br>
        That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles<br>
        And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."<br>
        And I was crying on the staircase<br>
        Begging you, "Please don't go."<br>
        And I said<br>
        <br>
        "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone<br>
        I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run<br>
        You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess<br>
        It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."<br>
        <br>
        So, I sneak out to the garden to see you<br>
        We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew<br>
        So, close your eyes<br>
        Escape this town for a little while<br>
        Oh, oh<br>
        <br>
        'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter<br>
        And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."<br>
        But you were everything to me<br>
        I was begging you, "Please don't go!"<br>
        And I said<br>
        <br>
        "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone<br>
        I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run<br>
        You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess<br>
        It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'<br>
        <br>
        Romeo, save me. They're tryna tell me how to feel<br>
        This love is difficult but it's real<br>
        Don't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess<br>
        It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."<br>
        <br>
        Oh, oh, oh<br>
        <br>
        I got tired of waiting<br>
        Wondering if you were ever coming around<br>
        My faith in you was fading<br>
        When I met you on the outskirts of town<br>
        And I said<br>
        <br>
        "Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone<br>
        I keep waiting for you, but you never come<br>
        Is this in my head? I don't know what to think."<br>
        He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said<br>
        <br>
        "Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone<br>
        I love you, and that's all I really know<br>
        I talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress<br>
        It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."<br>
        <br>
        Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
        <br>
        'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

      <h2>Paroles White Horse</h2>
      <h3>Sortie : 9 décembre 2008</h3>
      <div>
        Say you're sorry<br>
        That face of an angel<br>
        Comes out just when you need it to<br>
        As I paced back and forth all this time<br>
        'Cause I honestly believed in you<br>
        Holding on<br>
        The days drag on<br>
        Stupid girl<br>
        I should have known, I should have known<br>
        <br>
        That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale<br>
        I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet<br>
        Lead her up the stairwell<br>
        This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town<br>
        I was a dreamer before you went and let me down<br>
        Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around<br>
        <br>
        Maybe I was naïve<br>
        Got lost in your eyes<br>
        And never really had a chance<br>
        My mistake, I didn't know to be in love<br>
        You had to fight to have the upper hand<br>
        I had so many dreams<br>
        About you and me<br>
        Happy endings<br>
        Now I know<br>
        <br>
        That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale<br>
        I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet<br>
        Lead her up the stairwell<br>
        This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town<br>
        I was a dreamer before you went and let me down<br>
        Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around<br>
        <br>
        And there you are on your knees<br>
        Begging for forgiveness, begging for me<br>
        Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairy tale<br>
        I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well<br>
        This is a big world, that was a small town<br>
        There in my rear view mirror disappearing now<br>
        And it's too late for you and your white horse<br>
        Now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now<br>
        <br>
        Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
        Try and catch me now<br>
        Oh, it's too late<br>
        To catch me now

      <h2>Paroles You Belong With Me</h2>
      <h3>Sortie : 4 novembre 2008</h3>
      <div>
        You're on the phone with your girlfriend<br>
        She's upset, she's going off about something that you said<br>
        'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do<br>
        <br>
        I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night<br>
        I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like<br>
        And she'll never know your story like I do<br>
        <br>
        But she wears short skirts<br>
        I wear T-shirts<br>
        She's cheer captain<br>
        And I'm on the bleachers<br>
        Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find<br>
        That what you're looking for has been here the whole time<br>
        <br>
        If you could see<br>
        That I'm the one<br>
        Who understands you<br>
        Been here all along<br>
        So, why can't you see<br>
        You belong with me<br>
        You belong with me<br>
        <br>
        Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans<br>
        I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be<br>
        Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself<br>
        "Hey, isn't this easy?"<br>
        <br>
        And you've got a smile<br>
        That could light up this whole town<br>
        I haven't seen it in a while<br>
        Since she brought you down<br>
        <br>
        You say you're fine I know you better than that<br>
        Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?<br>
        <br>
        She wears high heels<br>
        I wear sneakers<br>
        She's cheer captain<br>
        And I'm on the bleachers<br>
        Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find<br>
        That what you're looking for has been here the whole time<br>

        Been here all along<br>
        So, why can't you see<br>
        You belong with me<br>
        <br>
        Standing by and waiting at your backdoor<br>
        All this time how could you not know, baby?<br>
        You belong with me<br>
        You belong with me<br>
        <br>
        Oh, I remember you driving to my house<br>
        In the middle of the night<br>
        I'm the one who makes you laugh<br>
        When you know you're 'bout to cry<br>
        I know your favorite songs<br>
        And you tell me about your dreams<br>
        Think I know where you belong<br>
        Think I know it's with me<br>
        <br>
        Can't you see<br>
        That I'm the one<br>
        Who understands you?<br>
        Been here all along<br>

      <h2>Paroles Fifteen</h2>
      <h3>Sortie : 30 août 2009</h3><div>
        You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors<br>
        It's the morning of your very first day<br>
        You say "Hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while<br>
        Try and stay out of everybody's way<br>
        It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here<br>
        For the next four years in this town<br>
        Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say<br>
        "You know I haven't seen you around before."<br>
        <br>
        'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you<br>
        You're gonna believe them<br>
        And when you're fifteen<br>
        Feeling like there's nothing to figure out<br>
        Well, count to ten, take it in<br>
        This is life before you know who you're gonna be<br>
        Fifteen<br>
        <br>
        You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail<br>
        And soon enough you're best friends<br>
        Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool<br>
        We'll be out of here as soon as we can<br>
        And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car<br>
        And you're feeling like flying<br>
        And your mamma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one<br>
        And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends<br>
        When the night ends<br>
        <br>
        'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you<br>
        You're gonna believe them<br>
        When you're fifteen<br>
        And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round<br>
        But in your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team<br>
        But I didn't know it at fifteen<br>
        <br>
        When all you wanted was to be wanted<br>
        Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now<br>
        <br>
        Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday<br>
        But I realized some bigger dreams of mine<br>
        And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind<br>
        And we both cried<br>
        <br>
        'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you<br>
        You're gonna believe them<br>
        And when you're fifteen<br>
        Don't forget to look before you fall<br>
        I've found time can heal most anything<br>
        And you just might find who you're supposed to be<br>
        I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen<br>
        <br>
        La, la, la, la, la, la, la<br>
        La, la, la, la, la, la, la<br>
        La, la, la, la, la, la, la<br>
        <br>
        Your very first day<br>
        Take a deep breath, girl<br>
        Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

        There's somethin' 'bout the way<br>
        The street looks when it's just rained<br>
        There's a glow off the pavement<br>
        You walk me to the car<br>
        And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there<br>
        In the middle of the parking lot<br>
        Yeah<br>
        Oh yeah<br>

        We're drivin' down the road<br>
        I wonder if you know<br>
        I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now<br>
        But you're just so cool<br>
        Run your hands through your hair<br>
        Absentmindedly makin' me want you<br>

        My hands shake<br>
        I'm not usually this way<br>
        But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave<br>
        It's the first kiss<br>
        It's flawless<br>
        Really something<br>
        It's fearless<br>
