        You'll see me in hindsight<br>
        Tangled up with you all night<br>
        Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down)<br>
        Someday, when you leave me<br>
        I bet these memories<br>
        Follow (Follow) you (You) around<br>
        (Follow you around)<br>
        <br>
        Say you'll remember me<br>
        Standing in a nice dress<br>
        Starin' at the sunset, babe<br>
        Red lips and rosy cheeks<br>
        Say you'll see me again<br>
        Even if it's just pretend<br>
        <br>
        Say you'll remember me<br>
        Standin' in a nice dress<br>
        Starin' at the sunset, babe<br>
        Red lips and rosy cheeks<br>
        Say you'll see me again<br>
        Even if it's just in your (Just pretend, just pretend)<br>
        Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ah)<br>
        In your wildest dreams, ah, ha<br>
        Even if it's just in your<br>
        In your wildest dreams, ah, ha<br>
        In your wildest dreams, ah, ha

        <h2>Paroles Out Of The Woods</h2>
        <h3>Sortie : 31 décembre 2015</h3>
        <div>
          Looking at it now<br>
          It all seems so simple<br>
          We were lying on your couch<br>
          I remember<br>
          You took a Polaroid of us<br>
          Then discovered (then discovered)<br>
          The rest of the world was black and white<br>
          But we were in screaming color<br>
          And I remember thinking<br>
          <br>
          Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
          Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
          Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
          Are we out of the woods?<br>
          Are we in the clear yet?<br>
          Are we in the clear yet?<br>
          Are we in the clear yet?<br>
          In the clear yet? Good<br>
          Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
          Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
          Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
          Are we out of the woods?<br>
          Are we in the clear yet?<br>
          Are we in the clear yet?<br>
          Are we in the clear yet?<br>
          In the clear yet? Good<br>
          Are we out of the woods?<br>
          <br>
          Looking at it now<br>
          Last December (last December)<br>
          We were built to fall apart<br>
          Then fall back together (back together)<br>
          Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck<br>
          The night we couldn't quite forget<br>
          When we decided (we decided)<br>
          To move the furniture so we could dance<br>
          Baby, like we stood a chance<br>
          Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying<br>
          And I remember thinkin'<br>
          <br>
          Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
          Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
          Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
          Are we out of the woods?<br>
          Are we in the clear yet?<br>
          Are we in the clear yet?<br>
          Are we in the clear yet?<br>
          In the clear yet? Good<br>
          Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
          Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
          Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
          Oh<br>
          Are we out of the woods?<br>
          Are we in the clear yet?<br>
          Are we in the clear yet?<br>
          Are we in the clear yet?<br>
          In the clear yet? Good<br>
          Are we out of the woods?<br>
          <br>
          Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?<br>
          Twenty stitches in a hospital room<br>
          When you started cryin', baby, I did, too<br>
          But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you<br>
          Remember when we couldn't take the heat<br>
          I walked out and said, "I'm settin' you free,"<br>
          But the monsters turned out to be just trees<br>
          When the sun came up, you were lookin' at me<br>
          <br>
          You were lookin' at me<br>
          You were lookin' at me<br>
          <br>
          Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
          Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
          Are we out of the woods yet?<br>
          Are we out of the woods?<br>
          I remember<br>
          Are we in the clear yet?<br>
          Are we in the clear yet?<br>
          Are we in the clear yet?<br>
          In the clear yet? Good<br>
          Oh, I remember<br>

        <h2>Paroles New Romantics</h2>
        <h3>Sortie : 13 avril 2016</h3>
        <div>
          We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything<br>
          We wait for trains that just aren't coming<br>
          We show off our different scarlet letters<br>
          Trust me, mine is better<br>
          <br>
          We're so young but we're on the road to ruin<br>
          We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing<br>
          We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom<br>
          Honey, life is just a classroom<br>
          <br>
          'Cause baby, I could build a castle<br>
          Out of all the bricks they threw at me<br>
          And every day is like a battle<br>
          But every night with us is like a dream<br>
          <br>
          Baby, we're the new romantics<br>
          Come on, come along with me<br>
          Heartbreak is the national anthem<br>
          We sing it proudly<br>
          We are too busy dancing<br>
          To get knocked off our feet<br>
          Baby, we're the new romantics<br>
          The best people in life are free<br>
          <br>
          We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding<br>
          We hang back, it's all in the timing<br>
          It's poker, he can't see it in my face<br>
          But I'm about to play my Ace<br>
          <br>
          We need love, but all we want is danger<br>
          We team up then switch sides like a record changer<br>
          The rumors are terrible and cruel<br>
          But, honey, most of them are true<br>
          <br>
          'Cause baby, I could build a castle<br>
          Out of all the bricks they threw at me<br>
          And every day is like a battle<br>
          But every night with us is like a dream<br>
          <br>
          Baby, we're the new romantics<br>
          Come on, come along with me<br>
          Heartbreak is the national anthem<br>
          We sing it proudly<br>
          We are too busy dancing<br>
          To get knocked off our feet<br>
          Baby, we're the new romantics<br>
          The best people in life are free<br>
          <br>
          So come on, come along with me<br>
          The best people in life are free<br>
          <br>
          Please take my hand and<br>
          Please take me dancing and<br>
          Please leave me stranded<br>
          It's so romantic (it's so romantic)<br>
          (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)<br>
          <br>
          Oh, 'cause baby, I could build a castle<br>
          Out of all the bricks they threw at me<br>
          And every day is like a battle<br>
          But every night with us is like a dream<br>
          <br>
          'Cause baby, I could build a castle (castle)<br>
          Out of all the bricks they threw at me<br>
          And every day is like a battle<br>
          But every night with us is like a dream<br>
          <br>
          Baby, we're the new romantics<br>
          Come on, come along with me<br>
          Heartbreak is the national anthem<br>
          We sing it proudly<br>
          We are too busy dancing<br>
          To get knocked off our feet<br>
          Baby, we're the new romantics<br>
          The best people in life are free
