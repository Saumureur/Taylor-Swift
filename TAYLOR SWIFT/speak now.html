      <h2>Paroles Mine</h2>
      <h3>Sortie : 4 août 2010</h3>
      <div>
        You were in college working part-time waiting tables<br>
        Left a small town, and never looked back<br>
        I was a flight risk with a fear of falling<br>
        Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts<br>
        <br>
        I say, "Can you believe it?"<br>
        As we're lying on the couch<br>
        The moment I could see it<br>
        Yes, yes, I can see it now<br>
        <br>
        Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?<br>
        You put your arm around me for the first time<br>
        You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter<br>
        You are the best thing that's ever been mine<br>
        <br>
        Flash forward and we're taking on the world together<br>
        And there's a drawer of my things at your place<br>
        You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded<br>
        You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes<br>
        <br>
        But we got bills to pay<br>
        We got nothing figured out<br>
        When it was hard to take<br>
        Yes, yes, this is what I thought about<br>
        <br>
        Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?<br>
        You put your arm around me for the first time<br>
        You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter<br>
        You are the best thing that's ever been mine<br>
        <br>
        Do you remember all the city lights on the water?<br>
        You saw me start to believe for the first time<br>
        You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter<br>
        You are the best thing that's ever been mine<br>
        <br>
        And I remember that fight<br>
        Two-thirty AM<br>
        As everything was slipping right out of our hands<br>
        I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street<br>
        Braced myself for the "Goodbye"<br>
        'Cause that's all I've ever known<br>
        Then you took me by surprise<br>
        You said, "I'll never leave you alone."<br>
        <br>
        You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water<br>
        And every time I look at you, it's like the first time<br>
        I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter<br>
        She is the best thing that's ever been mine."<br>
        <br>
        Hold on, make it last<br>
        Hold on, never turn back<br>
        <br>
        (Hold on)<br>
        You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter<br>
        (Hold on)<br>
        You are the best thing that's ever been mine<br>
        <br>
        (Hold on)<br>
        Yeah, yeah<br>
        Do you believe it?<br>
        (Hold on)<br>
        We're gonna make it now<br>
        (Hold on)<br>
        And I can see it<br>
        (Yes, yes)<br>
        I can see it now (see it now, see it now)

      <h2>Paroles Back To December</h2>
      <h3>Sortie : 15 novembre 2010</h3>
      <div>
        I'm so glad you made time to see me<br>
        How's life? Tell me how's your family?<br>
        I haven't seen them in a while<br>
        <br>
        You've been good, busier than ever<br>
        We small-talk, work and the weather<br>
        Your guard is up and I know why<br>
        <br>
        Because the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind<br>
        You gave me roses and I left them there to die<br>
        <br>
        So this is me swallowing my pride<br>
        Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night,"<br>
        And I go back to December all the time<br>
        <br>
        It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you<br>
        Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine<br>
        I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right<br>
        I go back to December all the time<br>
        <br>
        These days I haven't been sleeping<br>
        Staying up, playing back myself leaving<br>
        When your birthday passed and I didn't call<br>
        <br>
        And I think about summer, all the beautiful times<br>
        I watched you laughing from the passenger side<br>
        And realized I loved you in the fall<br>
        <br>
        And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind<br>
        You gave me all your love and all I gave you was "Goodbye"<br>
        <br>
        So this is me swallowing my pride<br>
        Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night."<br>
        And I go back to December all the time<br>
        <br>
        It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you<br>
        Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine<br>
        I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind<br>
        I go back to December all the time<br>
        <br>
        I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile<br>
        So good to me, so right<br>
        And how you held me in your arms that September night:<br>
        The first time you ever saw me cry<br>
        <br>
        Maybe this is wishful thinking<br>
        Probably mindless dreaming<br>
        But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right<br>
        <br>
        I'd go back in time and change it but I can't<br>
        So if the chain is on your door I understand<br>
        <br>
        But this is me swallowing my pride<br>
        Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night."<br>
        And I go back to December<br>
        <br>
        It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you<br>
        Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine<br>
        I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right<br>
        I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind<br>
        <br>
        I go back to December all the time<br>
        All the time

      <h3>Sortie : 14 mars 2011</h3>
      <div>
        And swords and weapons that you use against me<br>
        You have knocked me off my feet again<br>
        Got me feeling like I'm nothing<br>
        You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard<br>
        Calling me out when I'm wounded<br>
        You, picking on the weaker man<br>
        <br>
        Well, you can take me down<br>
        With just one single blow<br>
        But you don't know what you don't know<br>
        <br>
        Someday, I'll be living in a big old city<br>
        And all you're ever gonna be is mean<br>
        Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me<br>
        And all you're ever gonna be is mean<br>
        Why you gotta be so mean?<br>
        <br>
        You, with your switching sides<br>
        And your wildfire lies and your humiliation<br>
        You have pointed out my flaws again<br>
        As if I don't already see them<br>
        I walk with my head down, trying to block you out<br>
        'Cause I'll never impress you<br>
        I just wanna feel okay again<br>
        <br>
        I bet you got pushed around<br>
        Somebody made you cold<br>
        But the cycle ends right now<br>
        'Cause you can't lead me down that road<br>
        And you don't know what you don't know<br>
        <br>
        Someday, I'll be living in a big old city<br>
        And all you're ever gonna be is mean<br>
        Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me<br>
        And all you're ever gonna be is mean<br>
        Why you gotta be so mean?<br>
        <br>
        And I can see you years from now in a bar<br>
        Talking over a football game<br>
        With that same big loud opinion<br>
        But nobody's listening<br>
        Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things<br>
        Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing<br>
        But all you are is mean<br>
        All you are is mean<br>
        And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life<br>
        And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean<br>
        <br>
        But someday, I'll be living in a big old city<br>
        And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah<br>
        <br>
        Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me<br>
        And all you're ever gonna be is mean<br>
        Why you gotta be so mean?<br>
        Someday, I'll be living in a big old city<br>

      <h3>Sortie : 19 avril 2011</h3>
      <div>
        You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors<br>
        It's the morning of your very first day<br>
        You say "Hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while<br>
        Try and stay out of everybody's way<br>
        It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here<br>
        For the next four years in this town<br>
        Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say<br>
        "You know I haven't seen you around before."<br>
        <br>
        'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you<br>
        You're gonna believe them<br>
        And when you're fifteen<br>
        Feeling like there's nothing to figure out<br>
        Well, count to ten, take it in<br>
        This is life before you know who you're gonna be<br>
        Fifteen<br>
        <br>
        You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail<br>
        And soon enough you're best friends<br>
        Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool<br>
        We'll be out of here as soon as we can<br>
        And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car<br>
        And you're feeling like flying<br>
        And your mamma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one<br>
        And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends<br>
        When the night ends<br>
        <br>
        'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you<br>
        You're gonna believe them<br>
        When you're fifteen<br>
        And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round<br>
        But in your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team<br>
        But I didn't know it at fifteen<br>
        <br>
        When all you wanted was to be wanted<br>
        Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now<br>
        <br>
        Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday<br>
        But I realized some bigger dreams of mine<br>
        And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind<br>
        And we both cried<br>
        <br>
        'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you<br>
        You're gonna believe them<br>
        And when you're fifteen<br>
        Don't forget to look before you fall<br>
        I've found time can heal most anything<br>
        And you just might find who you're supposed to be<br>
        I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen<br>
        <br>
        La, la, la, la, la, la, la<br>
        La, la, la, la, la, la, la<br>
        La, la, la, la, la, la, la<br>
        <br>
        Your very first day<br>
        Take a deep breath, girl<br>
        Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

        And I'm a house of cards<br>
        You're the kind of reckless<br>
        That should send me running<br>
        But I kinda know that I won't get far<br>
        And you stood there in front of me<br>
        Just close enough to touch<br>
        Close enough to hope you couldn't see<br>
        What I was thinking of<br>
        <br>
        Drop everything now<br>
        Meet me in the pouring rain<br>
        Kiss me on the sidewalk<br>
        Take away the pain<br>
        'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile<br>
        Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down<br>
        Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around<br>
        'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile<br>
        <br>
        My mind forgets to remind me<br>
        You're a bad idea<br>
        You touch me once and it's really something<br>
        You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be<br>
        I'm on my guard for the rest of the world<br>
        But with you I know it's no good<br>
        And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        I'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild<br>
        Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right<br>
        And lead me up the staircase<br>
        Won't you whisper soft and slow?<br>
        I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show<br>
        <br>
        Drop everything now<br>
        Meet me in the pouring rain<br>
        Kiss me on the sidewalk<br>

      <div>
        Elevator buttons and morning air<br>
        Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs<br>
        If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares<br>
        But right now my time is theirs<br>
        <br>
        Seems like there's always someone who disapproves<br>
        They'll judge it like they know about me and you<br>
        And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do<br>
        The jury's out, but my choice is you<br>
        <br>
        So don't you worry your pretty little mind<br>
        People throw rocks at things that shine<br>
        And life makes love look hard<br>
        The stakes are high, the water's rough<br>
        But this love is ours<br>
        <br>
        You never know what people have up their sleeves<br>
        Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me<br>
        Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles<br>
        But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine<br>
        <br>
        And you'll say<br>
        Don't you worry your pretty little mind<br>
        People throw rocks at things that shine<br>
        And life makes love look hard<br>
        The stakes are high, the water's rough<br>
        But this love is ours<br>
        <br>
        And it's not theirs to speculate<br>
        If it's wrong and<br>
        Your hands are tough<br>
        But they are where mine belong and<br>
        I'll fight their doubt and give you faith<br>
        With this song for you<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I love the gap between your teeth<br>
        And I love the riddles that you speak<br>
        And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored<br>
        'Cause my heart is yours<br>
        <br>
        So don't you worry your pretty little mind<br>
        People throw rocks at things that shine<br>
        And life makes love look hard<br>
        Don't you worry your pretty little mind<br>
        People throw rocks at things that shine<br>
        But they can't take what's ours<br>
        They can't take what's ours<br>
        <br>
        The stakes are high, the water's rough<br>
        But this love is ours
