        I promise that you'll never find another like me<br>
        <br>
        I know that I'm a handful baby, uh<br>
        I know I never think before I jump<br>
        And you're the kind of guy the ladies want<br>
        (And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)<br>
        <br>
        I know that I went psycho on the phone<br>
        I never leave well enough alone<br>
        And trouble's gonna follow where I go<br>
        (And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)<br>
        <br>
        But one of these things is not like the others<br>
        Like a rainbow with all of the colors<br>
        Baby doll, when it comes to a lover<br>
        I promise that you'll never find another like me-e-e-eh<br>
        <br>
        Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
        I'm the only one of me<br>
        Baby, that's the fun of me-e-eh<br>
        Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh<br>
        You're the only one of you<br>
        Baby, that's the fun of you<br>
        <br>
        And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh<br>
        <br>
        <i>[Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift:]</i><br>
        I know I tend to make it about me<br>
        I know you never get just what you see<br>
        But I will never bore you, baby<br>
        (And there's a lot of lame guys out there)<br>
        <br>
        And when we had that fight out in the rain<br>
        You ran after me and called my name<br>
        I never wanna see you walk away<br>
        (And there's a lot of lame guys out there)<br>
        <br>
        'Cause one of these things is not like the others<br>
        Living in winter, I am your summer<br>
        Baby doll, when it comes to a lover<br>

        You are somebody that I don't know<br>
        But you're taking shots at me like it's Patrón<br>
        And I'm just like, "Damn!<br>
        It's 7 AM"<br>
        <br>
        Say it in the street, that's a knock-out<br>
        But you say it in a tweet, that's a cop-out<br>
        And I'm just like, "Hey!<br>
        Are you OK?"<br>
        <br>
        And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression<br>
        But I've learned the lesson<br>
        That stressing and obsessing<br>
        'Bout somebody else is no fun<br>
        And snakes and stones never broke my bones<br>
        <br>
        So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!<br>
        You need to calm down<br>
        You're being too loud<br>
        And I'm just like<br>
        "Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!<br>
        You need to just stop<br>
        Like, can you just not step on my gown?<br>
        You need to calm down"<br>
        <br>
        You are somebody that we don't know<br>
        But you're coming at my friends like a missile<br>
        Why are you mad<br>
        When you could be GLAAD?<br>
        (You could be GLAAD)<br>
        <br>
        Sunshine on the street at the parade<br>
        But you would rather be in the dark ages<br>
        Just making that sign<br>
        Must've taken all night<br>
        <br>
        You just need to take several seats<br>
        And then try to restore the peace<br>
        And control your urges to scream<br>
        About all the people you hate<br>
        'Cause shade never made anybody less gay<br>
        <br>
        So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!<br>

        And we see you over there on the Internet<br>
        Comparing all the girls who are killing it<br>
        But we figured you out<br>
        We all know now<br>
        We all got crowns<br>
        You need to calm down<br>

        Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!<br>
        You need to calm down<br>

        We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January<br>
        This is our place, we make the rules<br>
        And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear<br>
        Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?<br>
        <br>
        Can I go where you go?<br>
        Can we always be this close forever and ever?<br>
        And ah, take me out and take me home<br>
        You're my, my, my, my<br>
        Lover<br>
        <br>
        We could let our friends crash in the living room<br>
        This is our place, we make the call<br>
        And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you<br>
        I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all<br>
        <br>
        Can I go where you go?<br>
        Can we always be this close forever and ever?<br>
        And ah, take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)<br>

        <br>
        Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?<br>
        With every guitar string scar on my hand<br>
        I take this magnetic force of a man to be my<br>
        Lover<br>
        My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue<br>
        All's well that ends well to end up with you<br>
        Swear to be over-dramatic and true to my<br>
        Lover<br>
        <br>
        And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me<br>
        And at every table, I'll save you a seat<br>
        Lover<br>
        <br>
        Can I go where you go?<br>
        Can we always be this close forever and ever?<br>
        And ah, take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)<br>
        You're my, my, my, my<br>

        I would be complex, I would be cool<br>
        They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to<br>
        And that would be okay for me to do<br>
        Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you<br>
        <br>
        I'd be a fearless leader<br>
        I'd be an alpha type<br>
        When everyone believes ya<br>
        What's that like?<br>
        <br>
        I'm so sick of running as fast as I can<br>
        Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man<br>
        And I'm so sick of them coming at me again<br>
        'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man<br>
        I'd be the man<br>
        I'd be the man<br>
        <br>
        They'd say I hustled, put in the work<br>
        They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve<br>
        What I was wearing, if I was rude<br>
        Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves<br>
        <br>
        And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play<br>
        I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez<br>
        <br>
        I'm so sick of running as fast as I can<br>
        Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man<br>
        And I'm so sick of them coming at me again<br>
        'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man<br>
        I'd be the man<br>
        I'd be the man<br>
        <br>
        What's it like to brag about raking in dollars<br>
        And getting bitches and models?<br>
        And it's all good if you're bad<br>
        And it's okay if you're mad<br>
        If I was out flashing my dollars<br>
        I'd be a bitch, not a baller<br>
        They'd paint me out to be bad<br>
        So, it's okay that I'm mad<br>
        <br>
        I'm so sick of running as fast as I can<br>
        Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)<br>
        And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)<br>
        'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)<br>
        Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)<br>
        I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)<br>
        Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)<br>
        And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)<br>
        'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man<br>
        I'd be the man<br>
        I'd be the man (Oh)<br>
        I'd be the man (Yeah)<br>
        I'd be the man (I'd be the man)<br>
